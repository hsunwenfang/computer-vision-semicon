# Create a python project that features the following
1. use mlx compatible libraries to leverage the GPU of MacBook Air Series
2. efficiently read and process large datasets using GPU acceleration
3. includes a function to randomly generate 512 greyscale images of 128 x 128 pixels with int8 data type. Each image should include 10 random rectangles with varying widths, heights, positions, and border widths.
4. includes a function to blur the images using Gaussian filter, with adjustable kernel size and sigma.
5. includes a classifier that uses kernels to classify if certain type of rectangles are present in the images.
6. includes a function to evaluate the performance of the classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall and output the results as csv.
7. includes a function to visualize the images and the detected rectangles.
8. includes a function to save the generated images and the evaluation results.
